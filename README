A Super Gamedev Weekend 2012 Game

http://metalab.at/wiki/Super_Gamedev_Weekend


HOW TO
======

You need:

 - Python 2 or Python 3
 - PS Move API (http://thp.io/2010/psmove/) + Python bindings
 - PyGame (http://www.pygame.org/)
 - 2 or more PS Move Motion Controllers

Gameplay:

 1. Only the 4 buttons (square, triangle, cross, circle) are used
 2. When the controller glows WHITE, it's the player's turn
 3. The first player presses one of the 4 buttons, then it's the next
    player's turn
 4. The next player presses the button that the first player pressed, and
    another button of their choice, then it's the next player's turn
 5. The next player presses the button that the first player pressed and
    the button that the second player pressed and another button of their
    choice (and so on)
 6. If a player presses the wrong sequence, their are eliminated (the
    controller will vibrate and blink red) - the sequence is cleared, and
    the remaining players will battle to the end
